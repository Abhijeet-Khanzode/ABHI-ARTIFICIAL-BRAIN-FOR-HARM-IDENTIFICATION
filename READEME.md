## 🚀 How It Works

1. **Phishing Detection**  
   Extension monitors active tab URLs every 3 seconds and sends them to a Flask server hosting the trained ML model.

2. **Model Prediction**  
   If phishing is detected with confidence > 70%, it triggers a visual alert with a button to mark as "Not Phishing".

3. **User Feedback Loop**  
   Feedback is stored in `false_positive.csv` and used to **auto-retrain the model** via `auto_update_model.py`.

4. **ABHI AI Chat**  
   Clicking the alert opens a chat window powered by OpenAI API where users can interact with an assistant trained for cybersecurity.
